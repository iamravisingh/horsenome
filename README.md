# Horsenome 🎶🐎

Horsenome is a metronome inspired by the rhythmic beat of the **thapi**, the central sound of the dholak, an instrument I love to play. The name comes from how the **thapi** resembles the galloping rhythm of a horse's hooves — hence "Horsenome." 

This project combines my passion for music and coding, creating a tool that keeps perfect time and celebrates the essence of rhythm.

## Why "Horsenome"? 
The *thapi* of the dholak is not just a sound; it’s the heartbeat of the music. Its rhythm reflects the steady, galloping sound of horse hooves — **ghode ki naal**. Horsenome is an ode to that timeless connection between rhythm, music, and movement.
